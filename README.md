# Udacity-Data-Science-Proj-4: Churn Prediction with Spark

This repository contains the code I wrote for tackling project 4 in the [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) by Udacity.

## Problem Statement

This repository contains the code for using event data from an imaginary music streaming service called Sparkify to predict user churn. The data was provided by Udacity within the boundaries of a project in the Data Science Nanodegree program.

## Functionality

The recommendation engine is written in only one file, the "sparkify.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook. It can be executed as usual after cloning the repo.
The script can also be uploaded and ran on a distributed cluster on the cloud, such as an AWS EMR cluster.

The notebook contains the following content in order to making churn predictions:
* Get started
* Extracting data
* Cleaning data
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature engineering
* Modeling and evaluation

## Blogpost

The results are discussed in a  [blogpost](https://carstengranig.medium.com/churn-prediction-for-a-music-streaming-service-with-spark-dbc597662274) on Medium.
